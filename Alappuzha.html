<div class="desc">
<p style="font-family:verdana">Alappuzha also known by its former name Alleppey, is the administrative headquarters of Alappuzha district in the Indian state of Kerala. Alleppey is a city and a municipality in Kerala with an urban population of 174,164 and ranks third among the districts in literacy rate in the state. In 2016, the Centre for Science and Environment rated Alappuzha as the cleanest town in India. Alappuzha is considered to be the oldest planned city in this region and the lighthouse built on the coast of the city is the first of its kind along the Laccadive Sea coast.
  It is an important tourist destination in India. The Backwaters of Alappuzha is one of the most popular tourist attractions in Kerala which attracts millions of domestic and international tourists to the district and employs vast number of locals in the private sector.It connects Kumarakom and Cochin to the North and Quilon to the South.
  Kuttanad, the rice bowl of Kerala, with its paddy fields, small streams and canals with lush green coconut palms, was well known even from the early periods of the Sangam age. History says Alappuzha had trade relations with Greece and Rome in the Middle Ages.
  The early Cheras, who had their home in Kuttanad, were called `Kuttuvans`, so named after this place. Pliny and Ptolemy of the 1st and 2nd centuries had mentioned places like Purakkad or Barace in their classical works.
  Literary works like "Unnuneeli Sandesam" give some insight into the ancient period of this district. Archaeological antiquities, such as the stone inscriptions, historical monuments found in the temples, churches, and rock-cut caves, also emphasise the historic importance of Alappuzha District. Christianity had a foothold in this district, even from the 1st century AD. The church located at Kokkamangalam was one of the seven churches founded by St. Thomas,one of the twelve disciples of Jesus Christ. It is generally believed that he landed at Maliankara in Muziris Port, presently known as Cranganore or Kodungallur, in 52 AD and preached Christianity in South India.</P>
  <h3>Kuttanad Backwaters</h3> 
  <p>One of the best places to visit in Alleppey is Kuttanad Backwaters. This isn’t a place, it’s a phenomenon. It is a spectacular lagoon, surrounded by the beauty of lakes, rivers, canals, misty mountains and ethereal landscapes.

    The experience of floating along the pristine backwaters on a houseboat is inexplicable. You will have to live it to know it! The place is also known as the ‘Rice bowl of Kerala,’ for its stunning rice plantations. If you are in Alleppey for a day, then this place should be your entire itinerary.</P>
   
  <h3>Krishnapuram Palace</h3>
  <p>It is one of the most popular museums in Alleppey. Built-in the 18th century by the king of Travancore, Anizham Thirunal Marthanda Varma, Krishnapuram Palace is quite popular for its vintage architecture and artistic murals.

    Currently maintained by the Archaeological Department of Kerala, the palace is also home to the biggest mural painting of Kerala-- the 'Gajendra Moksha.’ The enriching mural painting covers an area of about 53 km, making this palace one of the most popular places to visit in Alleppey. </P>
  
    <h3>St. Andrew's Basilica Arthunkal</h3>
  <p>The largest shrine of St. Sebastian in the whole world, this church is one of the most popular Alleppey tourist places. The prestigious church was established in the 16th century and rebuilt in 1584, under Father Jacomo Fenicio, who was known to heal people with his touch.

    It has been renovated many times in history but always it has always stood tall and strong. With its majestic architecture and proximity to the Arthunkal Beach, St. Andrew’s Basilica is probably the most popular spiritual edifice in Alleppey. </P>

    <h3>Nehru Trophy Snake Boat Race</h3>
  <p>Held in the memory of Jawaharlal Nehru, this boat race is unlike any other boat racing activity you may have seen before. The Nehru Trophy Snake Boat Race, also known as Vallam Kali, is an annual competition that takes place every August on a part of Lake Vembanad. It is one of the cultural highlights of the state, so plan your visit accordingly if it is your desire to see and experience this boat race. 

    Unlike other boat racing events which have teams of 5 to 10 rowing furiously in silent concentration, this boat race has teams of at least 100 people, usually fishermen, who row together as they sing at the top of their voice. It is a wonderful experience to simply see the boats row past as you stand on the banks of the lake.
    
    If you feel like exploring and being offbeat, you could actually scout for the perfect secluded spot to watch the race on the banks of the lake. Else, go for the tickets for the bamboo stands set up especially for the race. The race is called a snake boat race because of the shape of the boats- long and snake-like. </P>

    <h3>Vembanad Lake</h3>
  <p>This is one of the most beautiful Alappuzha tourist places that you absolutely cannot miss. Vembanad Lake is Kerala’s longest lake and is also among the largest in India. Several canals empty their water into the lake at several points along its wide expanse. Since it is a long lake, it covers many districts of Kerala and goes by different names in each district like Punnamada Lake in Kuttanad, Kochi Lake in Kochi. Many small islands dot its length. 

    Boating in this lake is a part of backwater trip in Kerala. The Kumarakom Tourist Village offers houseboat cruises and holiday packages which you can take advantage of and so have the best possible backwater boating experience on your trip. The lake is full of exciting possibilities- just imagine yourself floating on the lake early in the morning, sipping a hot cup of coffee and listening to the gentle lapping of the waves and chirping of birds. Now that is peace and happiness! 
    
    If you get a chance to go to this place during August, you will be in luck. The Annual Snake Boat Race or Vallam Kali takes place at this time and is a major attraction. The sight is amazing, to say the least. Do plan a houseboat trip on the lake while planning your Kerala itinerary.</P>
