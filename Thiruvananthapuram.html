<p style="font-family:verdana">Thiruvananthapuram is a relatively modern region with trading traditions dating back to 1000 BCE. It is believed that the ships of King Solomon landed in a port called Ophir (now Poovar) in Thiruvananthapuram in 1036 BCE.The city was the trading post of spices, sandalwood and ivory.However, the ancient political and cultural history of the city was almost entirely independent from that of the rest of Kerala.
    Thiruvananthapuram, also known by its former name Trivandrum is the capital of the Indian state of Kerala.
    The present regions that constitute Thiruvananthapuram were ruled by the Ays who were feudatories of the Chera dynasty.In the 12th century, it was conquered by the Kingdom of Venad.In the 18th century the king Marthanda Varma expanded the territory and founded the princely state of Travancore and made Thiruvananthapuram its capital.Travancore became the most dominant state in Kerala by defeating the powerful Zamorin of Kozhikode in the battle of Purakkad in 1755. Following India's independence in 1947, Thiruvananthapuram became the capital of Travancore-Cochin state and remained so until the new Indian state of Kerala was formed in 1956.</P>
